## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is part of the CODTECH Python Internship Program, focusing on practical skills in real-time software development. The core objective of this task is to integrate an external API using Python, retrieve data dynamically, and present it through intuitive visualizations. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software systems to communicate, making them essential in building real-world applications.

In this project, I used the OpenWeatherMap API to collect weather data across different cities. The data returned by the API is in JSON format, which I parsed and transformed using Python's built-in tools. Once structured, the data was visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn, two of Python‚Äôs most powerful data visualization libraries. This helped to represent parameters like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions across various cities on charts and graphs.

The purpose of this task is not just to fetch data but to make it meaningful for analysis. It highlights how raw API data can be processed, cleaned, and turned into actionable visual insights. This project demonstrates a blend of data engineering (retrieving and cleaning data) and data science (visualizing and interpreting results).

##  TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED

- **Python** ‚Äì Used as the main programming language
- **Requests** ‚Äì To send HTTP GET requests to APIs
- **JSON** ‚Äì To parse and structure the API responses
- **Matplotlib** ‚Äì For line graphs, bar charts, and data plotting
- **Seaborn** ‚Äì For advanced visualization with styles and color palettes

## üñ•Ô∏è EDITOR USED

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** ‚Äì Used for file organization and extended coding

##  APPLICABILITY / USE CASES

This task is applicable in multiple domains of real-world applications:

-  **Weather Forecasting Systems** ‚Äì Creating live dashboards for weather updates
-  **Travel Applications** ‚Äì Integrating weather data to improve user travel experience
-  **Smart Cities** ‚Äì Connecting weather sensors with real-time analysis tools
-  **Student Projects** ‚Äì Ideal for those learning API integration and visualization
-  **Business Dashboards** ‚Äì Real-time insights on environmental or logistic data
-  **IoT Applications** ‚Äì Visualizing sensor data from API endpoints

## SUMMARY

This API Integration and Data Visualization project serves as a beginner-friendly yet powerful demonstration of how real-time data can be accessed, processed, and visualized in Python. It builds foundational knowledge useful for back-end development, machine learning preprocessing, and dashboarding. From writing clean code to creating visual outputs, the project reflects essential developer skills. It has equipped me with better understanding of how to consume APIs, handle JSON, and turn data into something visually valuable.
